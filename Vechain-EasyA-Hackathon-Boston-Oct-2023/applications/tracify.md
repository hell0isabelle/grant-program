### Overview

- Tracify is a groundbreaking blockchain-based platform, powered by VeChainThor, on a mission to transform the food industry's safety and transparency. It provides a practical solution for businesses and consumers to seamlessly track food products from their source to their ultimate destination, bolstering confidence in the supply chain. Leveraging the robust security and immutability of VeChainThor, Tracify ensures the legitimacy of organic and sustainable products.

### Ecosystem Fit
Loadproof and Deacom are both centralized 'solutions' to the supply chain problem by providing clear layouts of the entire process and supporting due diligence in the field - however their reliance on the cloud and incompatible software make them suceptible to things like data breaches, malware attacks, and ability to tamper with information. Tracify provides a decentralized, immutable solution on the Vechain blockchain that will eliminate all possibility of information tampering and dramatically lower the cost burden that is passed onto the general user. As a decentralized solution, we intend to have a consumer-first approach to our company and not charge any junk fees to consumers or community partners in order to encourage widespread adoption.

## Development Roadmap 


#### Overview
|  | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Total |
| - | - |- | - |
| Estimated Duration | 45 d | 45 d | 90 d |
| Full-time equivalent (FTE) | 3 | 3 | 6 |
| Cost (up to $ 30,000) | $ 12,500 | $ 15,000 | $ 27,000|

#### Milestone 1 — Front-end and Community Foundations

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | User Guide | We will provide a user guide or a demo video to show what features have been done.  |
| 2 | Dazzling Frontend | https://juno.build/blog/build-a-web3-app-with-vuejs JS (React/Vue.js) meant to captivate an audience with minimalist design that delivers the message loud and clear, and is also not complex, but has easily digestible information for those of varying skill levels. |
| 3 | Delivering Hype Through Community | We will use tactics such as guerrilla marketing to deliver hype across the City of Boston, as well as embark on a marketing campaign across crypto Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. Via the rallying of community support and strong believers of the project, we can draw attention to our initiatives and possibly gain additional supporters and community partners.  |
| 4 | Establishing token| Using vechain's provided developer kit, we plan to create a vechain-compatible token. Holders can stake tokens for early alerts, while helping network security. A portion of tokens are held in smart contracts to maintain scarcity and value. Earn TreaceCoin via engagement. Initially distributed through private sales or fundraising rounds. Then allocate tokens to incentivize and reward early supporters, team members, and advisors. Additionally, we will lay the groundwork for a governance structure meant to democratize participation in the whole process.  |
| 5 | Real-World Implementation Setup | We will connect with, at minimum, two neighborhood partners to begin sketching a roadmap for what Tracify implementation will look like in the real world. We intend to have this done within the first 21 days of recieving the grant. We plan to identify and propose our solutions at no cost to the community partner so that we can get a sense of what the initial rollout will look like.  |
| 6 | Initial MVP | We will provide an MVP hosted on our website that gives consumers and potential investors an idea of just how practical our solution is, as well as the current need in the market for a decentralized supply chain solution like Tracify. We will accept any and all feedback, as well as document all of our work and code here on Github. |

#### Milestone 2  —  Developed Backend and Beta Test Rollout
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 0a.| License and Documentation | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense.  We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that can interact with the deployed smart contracts and backend service.|
| 0b. | Test Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests |
| 1 | Backend and API | PostgreSQL to store non-blockchain data, Express.js to build a fast API that runs smoothly across platforms, as well as Python and Node.js for backend development and maintenance. We intend to use Filebase as our decentralized cloud service.  |
| 2 | Delivering to the Community | We plan on keeping our promise to community partners and assisting with every step of the Tracify launch, including onsite/on-call support should any technical issue arise, aiding in proposing solutions to common problems faced by those in agriculture and the food industry, as well as onboarding new customers to Tracify by creating easy-to-process media with many visuals and continuing to be a strong support for those onboarding to the platform. |
| 3 | Keeping True to our Mission | We intend to publish a significant amount of progress reports and updates, while making sure that the Vechain team and the Tracify team sync up whenever possible - as well as reviewing our backend on a daily basis and making any and all updates on an as-needed basis. We intend to follow through with our mission statement, and so far, we show no signs of slowing down. |
| 4 | Smart Contracts | https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/built-in-contracts We will develop smart contracts with Solidity that will allow for tokenized voting and the opportunity to stake TraceCoin in order to have a say in the governance process and also to promote token adoption across a variety of use cases within our ecosystem. A rough example would be:
    function mintVotingTokens(address[] memory _voters, uint256[] memory _amounts)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        require(_voters.length == _amounts.length, "Input arrays must have the same length");
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _voters.length; i++) {
            _mint(_voters[i], _amounts[i]);
        }
    }
    function vote(uint256 _proposalId) external hasNotVoted {
        require(_proposalId < totalSupply(), "Invalid proposal ID");
        
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;

    We will open source the smart contract and upload the ABI to [B32](https://github.com/vechain/b32). |


#### Community engagement

bublockchain.xyz is committed to providing high-quality updates that will be published and submitted per milestone and deliverable achieved. The first Medium article will be published within fourteen days of reciept of first grant. We additionally plan to cultivate a community on Telegram, Twitter, and Discord, to build a movement of Tracers (persons using our product) and quickly onboard them onto our platform. 


## Future Plans

Tracify's long-term vision combines technological innovation with a commitment to food safety, transparency, and sustainability. Our mission is to expand globally, forging partnerships that solidify Tracify as the unrivaled solution for traceability in the food industry. Continual technology enhancement ensures we remain at the forefront of our field, while regulatory compliance guarantees trust and reliability. We prioritize community engagement, fostering an active network where each participant plays a crucial role in enhancing food safety. Our native token, TraceCoin (TC), isn't just a means of exchange—it's a catalyst for innovation and user incentives. With applications stretching beyond the food sector, Tracify's research and development efforts are poised to unlock new opportunities. We're scaling for the global stage, all while maintaining unwavering commitments to data privacy, security, and ethical practices. Tracify is not just a platform; it's a movement toward a more transparent, sustainable, and secure future for all. Should we recieve funding from Vechain, we intend to work on Tracify for the absolute long term, and use Vechain's initial investment to further amplify the vision we had from day one. 

## Additional Information 

So far, we have created a pitch deck to get a grand vision of what our project will look like. We each have experience and are firsthand witnesses to many of the problems that Tracify looks to solve, and intend to deploy its services in communities free of charge to pilot the program. We are in talks with neighborhood kitchens and grocery currently about what that rollout would look like, and are beginning to establish partnerships. We have not applied for any other grants so far, and are hoping for Vechain's support on a project meant to deliver agricultural justice to the broader community. With Vechain's support, not only do we promise to bring more attention to the blockchain itself, but to the entire vechain ecosystem as a solution to the many issues faced in the web3 field. Our team has extensive experience in marketing/operations as well, and we intend to use that expertise to deliver a high-quality product meant to deliver agricultural justice to all people -- in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero hunger.

## Our funding breakdown would look a bit like this:
Product development (40%): This would be the to create an advanced, user-friendly platform using Vechain’s cutting-edge blockchain technology. 

Outreach and marketing (30%): To increase awareness and attract early adopters, start an aggressive marketing campaign in target audience environments.

Operations and Team (20%): Put together a world-class team of blockchain tech expertise, and to account for hosting site costs and the like.

Prepare for unforeseen opportunities and challenges (10%): To avoid any potential roadblocks in building the project, as well as to account for any emergency or unexpected costs encountered while building the project.
